this monorepo is intended for DRY and less code, in separated concern of browser environment and node.js environment. but I feel like the repograph handle too much repograph-core concern where I wish repograph is abstraction of repograph-core for node.js environment

but repograph-core should agnostic so not really care about both environment and features of specific environment
