please execute the scn-ts.report.md

===

what are needed to be prepare for repograph so that scn-ts can use repograph programmatic api as fundamental building block while to keep repograph out of scn concern. give me the analysis report

===

if programmer user wants to get only the related path.

===

if programmer user wants to build this format, can he do it with current public programmatic low-level api?

===

update readme to show detailed usage example like input and output both in high level and low level programmatic api

===

the low level api needs tests files and cases. give me the list in `it should` language

===

is the readme.md relevant/aligned with codebase? because I think the programmatic API still not aligned.
