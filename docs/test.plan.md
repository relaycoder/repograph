# RepoGraph Test Plan

This document outlines comprehensive testing strategies for RepoGraph, covering End-to-End (E2E), Integration, and Unit test cases. The test plan is organized by testing levels and follows the "should" format for clear test expectations.

## üéØ Testing Overview

RepoGraph is a functional, immutable TypeScript library that generates semantic codemaps. Testing focuses on:
- **Functional Pipeline**: File discovery ‚Üí Analysis ‚Üí Ranking ‚Üí Rendering
- **Immutability**: All data structures remain unchanged
- **Composability**: Custom pipeline components work correctly
- **Output Quality**: Generated Markdown is accurate and well-formatted
